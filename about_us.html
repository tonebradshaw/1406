	<h1>About Us</h1>
		<ul class="indent">
			<li>CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Viennaville since 2011.</li>
			<li>We create outstanding custom-made costumes.</li>
			<li>Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to 
				costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields.</li> 
			<li>Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.</li>
			<li>We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available) as well.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p  class="description">
		On the first Saturday of every month we hold a  &ldquo;CossiePlay Party&rdquo; at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, 
		$10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. 
		Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is 
		common (but not required).
